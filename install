   |    this bash script takes an input video file, chops it up at     |
   |    supplied interval, shuffles the clips, and merges them back    |
   |    together randomly. all temporary files are cleaned up and      |
   |    the output file is opened for preview. input file path         |
   |    must not have spaces.					                                 |
